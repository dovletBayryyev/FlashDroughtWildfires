# FlashDroughtWildfires

## 1. Goal
The goal of this work it to investigate the relationship between Flash Drought Events and Wildfires through geospatial data analysis.

## 2. Dataset
1. The first dataset used here was from a numerical model: the NASA Global Land Data Assimilation System Version 2.2 (GLDAS-2.2). 15 years of daily data was used in this project. This dataset was used to determine when flash drought event occured.
2. The second dataset used here was California wildfire data that showed when fires occured in the state of California. It was obtained from Cal Fire.

## 3. Methods Used
1. Statistical methods: frequency and trend analysis
2. Geographic Information System-based (GIS) approach

## 4. Technology 
The technology used here is a python notebook with libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, numpy, scipy, seaborn, xarray. In addition, a python script was written with the requests library to download (GLDAS-2.2) data.

## 5. Results
Results show showed there is in fact a relationship between flash drought and wildfires. More work and research needs to be done to understand the predicitve capability of flash drought events on widlfires occurences
